A Ranger's Best Friend: An update to Extra Gunslingers' Gear

New ranged gear, with additional gear supporting the hybrid ranger/summoner subclass

Sample of current content:
* Matchlock Pistol: starter pistol made from wood.
* Standard Issue: starter rifle made from iron.
* Starlight Accelerator: makes bullet travel time instant (hit-scan).
* Telescope: starlight accelerator + recon scope.
* Perfect Sync Emblem: avenger emblem + pygmy necklace

The wiki and mod are works in progress as I port old features from Extra Gunslingers' Gear. Not all features will be ported.
